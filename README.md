6 Channel Aquarium LED Driver

This repository contains the design files and supporting datasheets for a 6 channel 180W LED driver designed by Chris Fitzhugh.

The driver is based around a lM3404HV buck-boost driver designed by Texas Instruments.

Each channel is dimmable through a PWM dimming signal provided by an off board signal source.

The main power is a 48V input.

Output is done througha  DB-9 connector that runs the 6 LED power rails, a 12V rail for cooling fans and two ground lines.
